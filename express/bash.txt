Record Terminal sessions with timestamps

As one of our reader Mr.Alastair Montgomery mentioned in the comment section below, we could setup an alias which would timestamp the recorded sessions.

Create an alias for the script command like below.

$ alias rec=’script -aq ~/term.log-$(date “+%Y%m%d-%H-%M”)’

Now simply enter the following command start recording the Terminal.

$ rec
///

$ apropos "list directory"

asciinema // record terminal sassion
